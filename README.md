# About this application
This code delivers a way to traverse a matrix in spiral pattern in O(n*m) complexity - Where n is the numbe of rows and m is the number of columns. It can traverse any n x m arbitrary matrix dimension (not necessarily square matrix). The matrix must contain equal number of elements in every row. 

Here is how spiral matrix traverse looks:
